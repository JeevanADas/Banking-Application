# Banking-Application
This project is based on creating a banking application which can perform various banking transactions.

I have created the project with 3 other teammates in the third semester of my CSE.

This project basically has 2 main parts which are 
1)creating a new account 
2)Logging into an already existing account and performing actions like 
  a)debiting a certain amount from the bank account, 
  b)crediting a certain ammount into the account
  c)checking the account balance
  d)checking the transaction history

For every user we create a pair new data files in the .txt form, one of which contains the account details of the user and the other contains the transaction records of the account. so while performing transactions these files are mainpulated to make the changes in the account. 

We also have integrated a GUI into the code to make it user friendly, we have used the tkinter library for doing this function.
